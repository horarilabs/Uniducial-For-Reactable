# Uniducial-For-Reactable

Based on original Uniducial Scripts, a Fiducial controller for Unity.

- Added finger tracking control (implemented to only detect one finger movement). To enable it, put as fiducial id -1.
- Include a selector to use it with dual screen system. In that case, one of the screens shows information and the 
other (main) shows all the interaction with Reactable. In that case, its possible to determine wich is the main 
screen  (left or right) and the overlay to adjust the screen size and fiducial movements.
